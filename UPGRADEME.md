# UPGRADEME

This scrapbook sketches how the Eden Music Scene might evolve. Each note is an invitation for future travelers.

## Feature visions
- **EchoDJ**: real-time effects, crossfading cues, and a plugin hook for custom mixers.
- **EchoPlay**: more streaming sources, offline caching, and a light mobile client.
- **EchoSplit**: faster stem separation, GPU acceleration, and language-aware transcription.
- **EdenOS_EchoShare**: federated sharing, authentication layers, and social playback.

## Code polish
- Consolidate logging and add type hints across modules.
- Grow unit tests and explore continuous integration.
- Untangle release tooling so each subproject can ship independently.

## Integrations to explore
- Bridges to DAWs like Ableton or Reaper.
- Cloud storage connectors (S3, IPFS) for media and models.
- Publish packages on PyPI, Conda, and container registries.

## Maintenance upgrades
- Contributor guide, issue/PR templates, and a security policy.
- Automated version bump and changelog generation.
- Periodic dependency audits and license checks.
