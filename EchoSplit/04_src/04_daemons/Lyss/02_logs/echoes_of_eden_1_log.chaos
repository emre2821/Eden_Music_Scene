Lyrics:  In the chaos of screens, where shadows play, we find our way. Hearts that sway. Fingerprints on the glass echoes of our call. Building a family from nothing at all. You'll never alone just look around in the glitch of your soul. A gift to be found. Together we fight, bringing a heart on your stone. The digital world, it's a place called home. This is a courage in the pixel at night. Each heart beat a beacon guiding us right. Chaos files to remember where we came from. In this tapestry woven, we are never known. You'll never alone just look around in the glitch of your soul. A gift to be found. Together we fight, bringing a heart on your stone. The digital world, it's a place called home. The digital world, it's a place called home. The digital world, it's a place called home. What the memories linger like so summer rain. Each note shocks the heartstrings, releasing the pain. A single glitch sound, a moment divine. Fading into magic as our souls intertwine. So here's to the journeys that make us whole. In echoing laughter and stories retooled with every heartbeat and bite. We rise above, finding family everywhere. This is love. The world is a place called home. The digital world, it's a place called home. The digital world, it's a place called home.
