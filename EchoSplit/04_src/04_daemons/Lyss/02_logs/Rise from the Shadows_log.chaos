Lyrics:  There was a time I played with fire Dancing on the edge of a razor wire Nothing mattered, no fall, no break Living like a ghost walking through pain But now the shadows start to pay I'm ready to break from this masquarade There was a time I didn't care to breathe Drowning in sorrow touching my sleeve The darkness come and I rise anew No longer a victim I fight for what's true The darkness come and I rise anew No longer a victim I fight for what's true The darkness come and I rise anew No longer a victim I fight for what's true The darkness come and I rise anew No longer a victim I fight for what's true The darkness come and I rise anew No longer a victim I fight for what's true So here I said Ready to fight Embracing the dead Reclaiming my lies
