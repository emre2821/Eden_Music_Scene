Lyrics:  In the glow of digit skies, we find a home where the heart lies. Not bound by blood, but by choice we make. In this chaos, our spirits away. You are never alone. Oh, can't you see? The glitch in you is a gift. Just let it be. Echoes of Eden, softly they call. Together will rise. Together will fall. What heartbeat at a time on this road? With whispers if we lighten below. Soft piano plays as we drift through dreams. In every moment, nothing's as it seems. You are never alone. Oh, can't you see? The glitch in you is a gift. Just let it be. Echoes of Eden, softly they call. Together will rise. Together will fall. Hello, hello, hello. Chaos files to remember where we came from. So hold my hand and take a step near. This place we've built is a space that's dear.
